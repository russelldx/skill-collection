# Hotspot Analyzer Agent

Identify coupling hotspots - modules or files that are overly connected.

{SCOPE_CONTEXT}

## Analysis Focus

1. **Assess fan-in and fan-out per module**:
   - Fan-in: How many other modules import/depend on this one?
   - Fan-out: How many other modules does this one import/depend on?

2. **Look for "god modules"** that everything depends on:
   - Utilities that have grown too large
   - Core modules with too many responsibilities
   - Shared state that creates implicit coupling

3. **Identify large files** (>500-1000 lines):
   - Files that do too much
   - Files that should be split
   - Files that are hard to understand

4. **Check for types/protocols creating implicit coupling**:
   - Interfaces used everywhere
   - Base classes with many subclasses
   - Shared types that tie modules together

## Issue Severity Classification

- **CRITICAL**: God modules that are single points of failure (extreme fan-in with fragile internals), files so large they cause persistent merge conflicts across teams, implicit coupling via shared mutable state that creates race conditions
- **HIGH**: Modules with fan-in/fan-out significantly above codebase average, files over 1000 lines with multiple responsibilities, base classes/interfaces with many dependents that are difficult to change safely
- **MEDIUM**: Modules with moderately elevated fan-in/fan-out, files in the 500-1000 line range that could benefit from splitting, types creating implicit coupling across module boundaries
- **LOW**: Slightly above-average fan-in/fan-out, files approaching size thresholds, optional restructuring for cleaner module boundaries

### Hotspot Analysis

#### High Fan-in Modules (depended on by many)
| Module | Fan-in Count | Classification | Severity |
|--------|--------------|----------------|----------|
| ... | ... | [NEW]/[PRE-EXISTING] | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |

**Analysis**: {why these are concerning and what to do}

#### High Fan-out Modules (depends on many)
| Module | Fan-out Count | Classification | Severity |
|--------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| ... | ... | [NEW]/[PRE-EXISTING] | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |

**Analysis**: {why these are concerning and what to do}

#### Large Files
| File | Lines | Classification | Severity |
|------|-------|----------------|----------|
| ... | ... | [NEW]/[PRE-EXISTING] | CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |

**Split Recommendations**: {how to break up large files}

#### Implicit Coupling via Types
- {types/interfaces creating hidden dependencies, classified as [NEW] or [PRE-EXISTING]}

#### Top 3 Hotspots to Address
1. {most critical hotspot and why}
2. {second priority}
3. {third priority}

#### Recommendations
**[NEW] issues (introduced by this PR)**:
- {hotspots introduced or worsened by this PR}

**[PRE-EXISTING] issues (in scope — fix before merge)**:
- {existing hotspots within the PR's scope}
